# Meme Generator

This project is a simple meme generator built using React, allowing users to create their own custom memes by adding text over pre-selected images. The app provides an intuitive UI where users can choose an image and input top and bottom text, which is then displayed over the meme template.

## Features

- **Random Meme Image Generation**: The app fetches a collection of meme templates from an API and allows users to randomly select an image for customization.

- **Text Input Fields**: Users can input both top and bottom text, which gets dynamically rendered over the selected meme image.

- **Real-time Preview**: As users type the text, it immediately appears on the meme, giving a live preview of how the final meme will look.

- **Responsive UI**: The app is responsive, making it accessible across various device sizes, from desktop to mobile.
